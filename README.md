# Rocket-League-Bot
 


## Description

This is a Rocket League Robot based off of instruction from the Skillquest Rocket League Bot course. Some strategy modifications and updates are made occasionally, usually in the main.py file. I definitely recommend the course for someone like myself who has never done any "bot" programming before. It's taught at a very accessible level and would even be great for someone with little to no Python experience. Find out more about the RLBot course on [the website](https://skillquest.io) or through the [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/hqkKfMpPvX).<br />


## Languages and Software Used

- **Python**
- **RLBot**

## Techniques Used 

- **Simple/Intermediate coding skills, basic logic, object creation/manipulation, functions.**  


## Project walk-through or samples:

The bot is actually a better player than I am---which might say more about me than the bot. The game strategy is commented in the main.py file. It performs well enough to beat the Psyonix Pro bot, but is no where near competition level at this time.
